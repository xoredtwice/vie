- [[2002] Evaluating Security of Voting Schemes in the Universal Composability Framework](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/002)

	> "As a solution to this, we suggest evaluating voting schemes in the universal composability framework. We investigate the popular class of voting schemes based on homomorphic threshold encryption. It turns out that schemes in this class realize an ideal voting functionality that takes the votes as input and outputs the result." ([PDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/002.pdf))

	> "Proof of Security. In this section we give the proof that the protocol securely realizes Pollster-Immune 43 -CRRT in the UC model. The proof follows the standard outline for a UC proof: we describe an ideal adversary, ..." ([PDF](https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2006/40040089/40040089.pdf))

- [[2007] Simulation-based analysis of E2E voting systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1787456.1787473)

	> "We now would like to show that a real voting system securely emulates this ideal functionality. To this purpose, we use the notion of secure emulation, as proposed in the universally composable (UC) security framework [12], or in the reactive simulatability framework [13] for instance."

- [[2015] New Techniques for Electronic Voting](https://www.usenix.org/conference/jets15/workshop-program/presentation/szepieniec)

	> "This paper presents a novel unifying framework for electronic voting in the universal composability model that includes a property which is new to universal composability but well-known to voting systems: universal verifiability. Additionally, we propose three new techniques for secure electronic voting and prove their security and universal verifiability in the universal composability framework. ...

	> "In this work we put forward the first universally composable notion of incoercible multi-party computation, which satisfies the above intuition and does not assume collusions among coerced parties or knowledge of the corrupted set. ..." ([PDF](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/PUBLIC/182.pdf))

- [[2017] Statement Voting](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/616)

	> "We initiate the study of statement voting under the Universal Composability (UC) framework, and propose several construction frameworks together with their instantiations. As an application, we show how statement voting can be used to realize a UC-secure liquid democracy voting system. ..." ([PDF](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/616.pdf))

	> "In this work, we explore the prospect of decentralized e-voting where security is preserved under concurrent protocol executions. In particular, we provide the first comprehensive formalization of STE in the universal composability (UC) framework introduced by Canetti [FOCS â€™01] via an ideal functionality that captures required security properties such as voter privacy, eligibility, fairness, one-voter one-vote, and verifiability ..."
